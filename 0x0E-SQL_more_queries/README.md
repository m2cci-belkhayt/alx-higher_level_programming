# Project Title: MySQL Database Management

## Project Description

This project focuses on MySQL database management, covering various aspects such as user creation, privilege management, constraints, and querying techniques. The learning objectives include understanding how to create MySQL users, managing user privileges, working with primary and foreign keys, utilizing constraints, and retrieving data from multiple tables using joins and unions.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:

1. Create a new MySQL user
2. Manage privileges for a user on a database or table
3. Understand and implement PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY concepts
4. Use NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints in database design
5. Retrieve data from multiple tables using joins
6. Implement subqueries in SQL
7. Use JOIN and UNION operations effectively
